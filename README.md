# js-auto-complete
A simple example of an autocomplete element.

I ran across a site recently where a user asked about creating an Auto-Complete feature on his website. As I was read through the answers, I was a little sad that nobody could offer any advice other than to use some plug-in or another. I was sad because this is a fairly trivial programming exercise.
I don't want to sound like a JavaScript snob; I am conversant with any number of JS libraries. It just seems to me that in this case, there is not much of a need for any, other than JQeury for convenience.
I consider this an intermediate-level exercise, but I think the code is simple enough to be understood by beginners. (Maybe).
